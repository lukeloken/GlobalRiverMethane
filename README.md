# GlobalRiverMethane (GRiMe)

A repo to enable Emilyâ€™s methane problem. Bonus features include
functions and scripts to analyze a global dataset of methane in flowing
waters.

### Setup

This repo only contains scripts and example data. The data, analyses,
figures, etc. are saved on your local dropbox folder. To use the
functions and scripts in this package, you will create an R object with
the path to your local dropbox directory. You should only need to do
this once, and all functions will access and create files within that
folder.

``` r
path_to_dropbox <- "Your/local/dropbox/folder"
```

### Example

``` r
# Example code
```

### More to be added

``` r
# Example code
